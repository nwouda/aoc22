# Hello there

This is just a collection of my Advent of Code "answers". I use Jupyter Notebooks because it allows me to quickly review if a piece of code functions as it should. 

Not all notebooks cover both parts as I mostly just adjusted my code to get the answer of part two, altering the outcome.

p.s. Uncle Bob, please look the other way ;-)
